    { question: "What is Ravdesk?", answer: "Ravdesk is a blockchain-based platform built on Base that simplifies and secures freelance and business collaborations using smart contract escrow." },
    { question: "How does the escrow work?", answer: "Clients deposit funds into a smart contract. Funds are released based on milestones or a time lock, with approval from all parties or the admin." },
    { question: "Who can deploy a contract?", answer: "Any user with a connected Base-compatible wallet or third-party sign-in (Google, Apple) can deploy a contract via the Dashboard." },
    { question: "Whatâ€™s the difference between milestone lock and time lock?", answer: "Milestone lock releases funds as tasks are completed; time lock releases funds after a set date, both requiring approval." },
    { question: "Can I use Google or Apple to sign in?", answer: "Yes, sign in with Google or Apple to access the platform, then connect your wallet for blockchain features." },
    { question: "How are disputes handled?", answer: "The fixed admin can cancel contracts, or all parties must agree to cancel and refund remaining funds." },
    { question: "Why Base?", answer: "Base provides fast, low-cost transactions, ideal for frequent contract interactions." },
    { question: "Is my data secure?", answer: "Third-party sign-ins use secure OAuth protocols, and wallet interactions are managed by MetaMask." },
    { question: "How do I get started?", answer: "Sign in with Google, Apple, or connect your wallet on the home page, then access the Dashboard." },

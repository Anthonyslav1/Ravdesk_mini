# Farcaster Frame Image Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the Farcaster frame image.

## Required Image Specifications

Create a PNG image with these specifications:
- **Dimensions**: 1145x600px (1.91:1 aspect ratio)
- **File name**: `farcaster-frame.png`
- **Content**: Ravdesk Escrow branding with clear title and visual elements
- **Format**: PNG with transparent or solid background

## Usage

This image is used for:
- Farcaster frame previews
- OpenGraph social sharing
- Miniapp thumbnails

## Temporary Solution

For now, the app uses hosted placeholder images from `placehold.co` until a proper branded image is created.

Replace this `.md` file with the actual `farcaster-frame.png` image before production deployment.
